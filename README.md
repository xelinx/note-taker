# note-taker
Create the backend to an application that can write, save, and delete notes. Express will be used and notes will be saved and retrieved using JSON.

This assignment already has the frontend developed. I was able to get the server running and display the first page of the application, but when I click the button to "Get Started" on the index.html page, it does not redirect the app to notes.html. I'm a bit frustrated because I keep checking over my code but I cannot seem to find what's wrong. Also, the app functions when I go to localhost:8080, however when I check Heroku, the app is not deployed to show at least the initial functioning page.
