# note-taker
Create the backend to an application that can write, save, and delete notes. Express will be used and notes will be saved and retrieved using JSON.

This assignment already has the frontend developed. I was able to get the server running and display the index.html and the notes.html. However, notes.html is not displaying with the CSS styling even though I made sure the file was linked. Opening notes.html in the default browser shows me the html page with the correct CSS. I'm a bit frustrated because I keep checking over my code but I cannot seem to find what's wrong.
